# Welcome to My Personal Website

This is my personal website to get to know more about me and my progress, this website and all the corresponding styles is truly inspired by [Superrb](https://www.superrb.com) and animation of this website is with the help of [Animate Style](https://animate.style) and the helpful people mentioned below.

## About the Website

This website is built with Next JS and Tailwind, inspired by [Superrb](https://www.superrb.com) and animation of this website is with the help of [Animate Style](https://animate.style). To install Animate Style to your project:

```
$ npm install animate.css --save
```

Add it directly to your webpage using a CDN:

```
<head>
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css"
  />
</head>
```

To implement it to your corresponding element you want to animate:

- After installing Animate.css, add the class animate**animated to an element, along with any of the animation names (don't forget the animate** prefix!):

```
<h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce">An animated element</h1>
```

- And for more information you can deep dive to their website: [Animate Style](https://animate.style).
